    <p><h2>Preamble</h2></p>
    Langos is a traditional hungarian street food. It's litteraly 'flamer' or 'flamey' but can be called fried bread.

    <p><h2> Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
   <li> 300 g all-purpose flour (plus extra on hand)</li>
   <li> 7 g dried (instant) yeast</li>
   <li> 250 ml water</li>
   <li> Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
   <li> peanut oil for frying</li>
 
    </ul>

<p><h2> Instructions</h2></p>
<h3>Making the dough</h3>
<ol> 
<li> Sift in the flour into a bowl. </li>
<li>Mix salt and water together in a mug. </li>
<li>Add the salt water to the flour</li>
<li> Mix the dough and water. I recomend kneeding with your hands. Sprinkle flour in and keep kneeding until the dough is smooth and stops sticking to the bowl.</li>
<li> Coat the bowl with flour so the dough doesn't stick. Cover with a clean cloth and leave it to rise for about 30-40 mins. You can also let is rise overnight
    in the fridge if cooking for an event and want to prepare earlier. </li>
</ol>

<p><h3> Preperation and cooking</h3></p>
<ol>
    <li>Once the dough has risen, cut  pieces off, flatten in your hand and stretch them out. Or roll out on a floured surface and cut out pieces with a glass, 
        then stretch. Aim for about 10cm diameter pieces. When stretching out, the middle should be thinner than the edges<li>
    <li>Leave pieces to rest another 30 mins on a floured surface. If the dough rested overnight,I found this step isn't really needed  </li>
    <li>Heat up some oil - I use peanut oil, original recipe recomends sunflour oil </li>    
    <li> Test the oil is hot enough with a small piece of dough. Then fry your langos. Approx 30 seconds per side, or however long is takes to get each side golden 
    brown. Repeat with all for our langos  </li>
    </ol>

<p><h3> Serving</h3></p>
 <ol>
    <li>Langos is best served hot. Or you can try heat it back up in the oven, but fresh is best</li>
    <li><b>Try it with... </b></li>
    <ul>
    <li>Plain - maybe add some salt</li>
    <li>Garlic - cut the end of a clove off, and make some extra serations. Rub on langos. </li>
    <li>Cheese and sour cream - spread some sour cream, then spinkle grated tasty cheese on </li>
</ul>
</ol>
